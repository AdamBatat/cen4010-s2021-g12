            <p>Name: Ian Coston</p>
            <p>Major: Computer Engineer and Computer Science</p>
            <p>My Name is Ian Coston. I have been at Florida Atlantic University since 2016 and I am graduating Spring of 2021 with a dual degree and a certificate. I am immediately going back to school afterwards to get my masters in Artificial Intelligence. My passion in the technology field actually has to do with machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as quantum computing. I find both of these fascinating because I can see how they would shape the way we live in the future and not just in the future but also in the now. Everything around us has some sort of form of Artificial Intelligence whether it is something like a cell phone or even something like a car. I can see that this is where the future is going and that fascinates me significantly. I can also see quantum computing being part of the future. As of right now, we do have quantum computers but they do require extreme cold environment. My goal in the future is to help make a difference and bring the two technologies together to help make the world a better place.&nbsp;</p>
